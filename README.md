Hi! I'm a computer science student at Queens College, graduating in 2025, now seeking my first software engineering role. Check out my [personal site here](https://shahjacob.netlify.app/) for my project work and to view my resume.

I most recently interned at [Pharmesol AI](https://www.pharmesol.com/) as a full-stack engineering intern, helping building out their backend API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and integrating LLM Voice Agents using [Retell AI](https://www.retellai.com/). I also built customer dashboards in React using [Tremor.js](https://tremor.so/).

I'm now most interested in backend/infra, with a focus on designing APIs, observability, containerization, internal tooling, and distributed systems.

### What I build recently:

* [**YFinance Market Data Observability Platform**](https://github.com/shahjacobb/Market-Data-API-Observability-Platform) - A real-time observability platform that monitors requests to the YFinance API. Built with FastAPI, Prometheus for metrics collection, and Grafana for visualization. Containerized using Docker Compose.
